# BotAGI MT5 - Trading Robot

This code is a sample trading robot designed to analyze the Forex market using indicators and algorithms and execute trades automatically based on the market analysis. The robot uses moving averages to identify potential trading opportunities and executes buy or sell trades accordingly.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you need to have the MetaTrader 5 platform installed and set up. Once you have the platform running, you can copy and paste this code into a new Expert Advisor (EA) file.

## Prerequisites

This code requires the following libraries and headers:

- Trade.mqh: This library provides functions for trading operations.
- Indicators.mqh: This library provides functions for technical indicators.

## Global Variables

The code declares two global variables:

- `magicNumber`: This variable is used to identify the trades executed by the robot.
- `slippage`: This variable sets the maximum allowed slippage in pips.

## Function: analyzeMarket()

This function is responsible for analyzing the Forex market using indicators and algorithms. It calculates moving averages and checks for crossovers to determine trading signals.

The function uses the `iMA()` function from the Indicators library to calculate the fast and slow moving averages. It then checks for a bullish crossover (when the fast moving average is above the slow moving average) or a bearish crossover (when the fast moving average is below the slow moving average).

If a bullish crossover is detected and there are no open positions, the function executes a buy trade using the `OrderSend()` function from the Trade library. The lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels are specified, and the trade is executed with the specified magic number and slippage.

If a bearish crossover is detected and there are no open positions, the function executes a sell trade in a similar manner.

## Function: executeTrades()

This function continuously analyzes the market by calling the `analyzeMarket()` function and waits for 5 seconds before analyzing the market again. This allows the robot to keep track of any changes in the market and execute trades accordingly.

## Function: OnStart()

This function is the entry point of the program. It calls the `executeTrades()` function to start the automatic trading process.
